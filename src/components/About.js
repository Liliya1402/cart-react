        Dress Store all started with a simple visit to the mall. Derrick + Danielle  were walking through our average local mall with Danielle's sisters, and were exhausted after browsing through endless stores that all had the same premise - overpriced clothing that lacked style and the items were the same month after month. Danielle walked out of the final store and told Derrick, "This is ridiculous, we should open our own store. We should offer new styles every week, make it affordable and on trend."
